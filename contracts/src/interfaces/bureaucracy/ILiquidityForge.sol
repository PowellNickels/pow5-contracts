 * Collateralize the LP-NFT with a collateralization ratio of up to 100x in
 * return for a POW5 loan with negative interest.
 *
 * Like US dollars, POW5 is loaned into existence. Loan interest is set by an
 * inverted yield curve.
 *
 * Loans can be refinanced at any time. While collateralized, the DeFi
 * can be claimed by repaying the POW5 (which is destroyed) or by using a flash
 * loan.
 *
 * If the player defaults on the POW5 loan, the game is over for that LP-
 * and the player walks away with the POW5 principal plus interest and claimed
 * DeFi yield. Staked value and unclaimed yield is sold off by The Reserve for
 * the unpaid POW5 (which is destroyed). The empty LP-NFT returned to the
 * player as a keepsake.
